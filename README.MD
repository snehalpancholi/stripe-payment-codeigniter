# Stripe Payment Gateway - Codeigniter

Stripe is an online payment processing platform and payment gateway that simplifies the process of accepting payments from customers. Stripe allows businesses to easily accept payments from customers in a secure and efficient manner.

Integrating Stripe Payment Gateway into your PHP CodeIgniter application is a relatively simple process. To get started, you'll need to create a Stripe account, which requires you to provide some basic information about your business. Once your account is created, you'll be given a set of API keys that you'll need to integrate the Stripe Payment Gateway into your application.
